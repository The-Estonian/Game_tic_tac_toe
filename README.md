# Game_tic_tac_toe
My version of the game "Tic-Tac-Toe" made to work in windows cmd terminal.
Game pulled out of my SDA-Tasks repository to keep it separate. All of the development (~100) commits still remain there.

Created old school loading screen and menu for some eye candy.

No external modules installed and played around with built-in modules like: 
"os" to clear terminal screen for some eye candy and cleanness, 
"time" for time delay effects and loading screen. 
"random" to give loading screen some randomness in loading time and to use weights on bot choices to make it more competitive.
